# 📡 Packet Tracer: Peer-to-Peer & Client-Server Networks

This repository contains a networking project built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The project demonstrates two fundamental network topologies:

- **Peer-to-Peer Network** with static IP addressing
- **Client-Server Network** with DHCP configuration

## 📝 Project Details

- Devices configured: PCs, Switches, and a Server
- Used protocols: ICMP (ping), DHCP
- Skills applied: IP addressing, cabling, connectivity testing

## 🗂️ Files Included

- `Building Client Server Network.pkt` — The Packet Tracer project file
- `README.md` — Project description and documentation

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download the `.pkt` file
2. Open it in **Cisco Packet Tracer**
3. Observe both topologies in the same workspace
4. Use the **Command Prompt** on PCs to test connectivity with `ping`

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand differences between peer-to-peer and client-server models
- Practice configuring static IPs and DHCP settings
- Test and verify basic network communication using ping
